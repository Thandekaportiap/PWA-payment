# Payment System Fixes Applied

## Overview
Your payment system had several frontend-backend integration issues that have been identified and fixed. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of what was found and corrected.

## Issues Found & Fixes Applied

### 1. **API Base URL Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend was calling `localhost:3001/api` but backend runs on `localhost:8080/api/v1`
- **Fix**: Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js` line 1:
  ```javascript
  // Before
  const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001/api';
  
  // After  
  const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1';
  ```

### 2. **User Registration Endpoint Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend calling `POST /users` but backend expects `POST /users/register`
- **Fix**: Updated `createUser` function to use correct endpoint
- **Backend Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/users/register`

### 3. **Subscription Creation Endpoint Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend calling `POST /subscriptions` but backend expects `POST /subscriptions/create`
- **Fix**: Updated `createSubscription` function to use correct endpoint
- **Backend Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/create`

### 4. **Payment Endpoints Mismatch** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Frontend using `/payment/` but backend uses `/payments/`
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - `initiatePayment`: Now calls `POST /api/v1/payments/initiate`
  - `getPaymentStatus`: Now calls `GET /api/v1/payments/status/{merchant_transaction_id}` (was POST with body)

### 5. **Payment Status Polling Function** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: `pollPaymentStatus` was passing incorrect parameters to `getPaymentStatus`
- **Fix**: Simplified to only require `merchantTransactionId` parameter
- **Before**: `pollPaymentStatus(internalPaymentId, peachCheckoutId, merchantTransactionId)`
- **After**: `pollPaymentStatus(merchantTransactionId)`

### 6. **Missing Health Check Endpoint** ‚úÖ ADDED
- **Issue**: Frontend calling health check but backend didn't have one
- **Fix**: Added health check endpoint to backend at `GET /health`
- **Frontend**: Updated to call correct URL `http://localhost:8080/health`

## Database.rs Analysis

Your database.rs file is generally well-structured, but here are some observations:

### ‚úÖ **Good Practices Already Implemented**:
- Proper async/await usage
- Good error handling with Result types
- Proper UUID generation for IDs
- Comprehensive CRUD operations
- Good separation of concerns

### üîç **Potential Improvements** (No changes made, just observations):

1. **Connection Pooling**: Consider using connection pooling for better performance in production
2. **Transaction Support**: For operations that modify multiple tables, consider using database transactions
3. **Batch Operations**: For recurring payment processing, batch operations could improve performance
4. **Caching**: Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data like user subscriptions

## Backend API Endpoints Summary

Here are all the available endpoints in your backend:

### Users
- `POST /api/v1/users/register` - Create new user
- `GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}` - Get user by ID
- `GET /api/v1/users/email/{email}` - Get user by email

### Subscriptions  
- `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/create` - Create subscription
- `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}` - Get subscription
- `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/renew` - Renew subscription

### Payments
- `POST /api/v1/payments/initiate` - Start payment process
- `GET /api/v1/payments/status/{merchant_transaction_id}` - Check payment status
- `POST /api/v1/payments/charge-recurring` - Process recurring payment
- `GET /api/v1/payments/checkout-status/{checkout_id}` - Check checkout status
- `GET /api/v1/payments/callback` - Payment callback (GET)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/callback` - Payment callback (POST)

### Notifications
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/user/{user_id}` - Get user notifications
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}/acknowledge` - Mark notification as read

### System
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Frontend Structure

You have two frontend implementations:

1. **React Frontend** (`/frontend/`): Modern React app with components, proper API service layer
2. **Static Frontend** (`/front/`): Simple HTML/JS implementation

Both should now work correctly with the backend after these fixes.

## Testing Your Fixes

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo run
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Or use the static frontend**: Open `front/static/index.html` in your browser

## Next Steps

1. **Test the user registration flow** - Should now work correctly
2. **Test subscription creation** - Should connect to proper endpoint
3. **Test payment initiation** - Should use correct payment endpoints
4. **Monitor the health check** - Should show green status when backend is running

All the major integration issues have been resolved. Your payment system should now have proper frontend-backend communication!
